first foray into github - nothing to see here, move along

adding stuff here just to see something happen
no tacos for lunch

this is on line 7 in edit mode
<this is a new line 8>  continuing on same line 8, but line 9 will have nothing...

this was typed on line 10.  Checking if periods signal anything,
Now on line 11, with a black line 12 following this.


highly unimpressed with this as a simple text editor.  It has rules/behavior like no other I've seen.

Changing from soft wrap mode to no wrap mode.  Curious what happens.
